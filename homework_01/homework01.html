    <h1>Sherlock Holmes</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Sherlock Holmes</strong> is a fictional detective created by
      British author
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle">
        <em>Arthur Conan Doyle</em>
      </a>
      . Referring to himself as a "consulting detective" in his stories, Holmes
      is known for his proficiency with observation, deduction, forensic science
      and logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic, which he employs when
      investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including Scotland
      Yard.

      The character Sherlock Holmes first appeared in print in 1887's A Study in
      Scarlet. His popularity became widespread with the first series of short
      stories in The Strand Magazine, beginning with "       
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Scandal_in_Bohemia">
        <em>A Scandal in Bohemia</em>
      </a>      
      " in 1891; additional tales appeared from then until 1927, eventually totalling
      four novels and 56 short stories. All but one[a] are set in the Victorian
      or Edwardian eras between 1880 and 1914. Most are narrated by the
      character of Holmes's friend and biographer, Dr. John H. Watson, who
      usually accompanies Holmes during his investigations and often shares
      quarters with him at the address of <em>221B Baker Street, London</em>
      , where many of the stories begin.
